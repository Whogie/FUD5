# Back-end development notes

## Yelp API query

### Process

#### 1. **Construct and send an OAuth 1.0a request via the Yelp API service using front-end data (location & user preferences).**

##### a. **Construct the Yelp API service with**:
    
* Consumer key
* Consumer secret
* Token key
* Token secret
    
##### b. **Form an OAuth request**
It has the form:

    http://api.yelp.com/v2/search?...

###### i. Parameters

We need at minimum a location, though practically we would always want a minimum category filter of "food" (includes restaurants, food trucks, etc.)

* location: needs to have at least one of city, state, or ZIP. 
* category_filter: "food" should probably be always sufficient
* term: search term(s) within food
* cll: latitude & longitude
* limit: how many search results to return
    
###### ii. Use device location

We must determine at least a city or ZIP from the device's location *and* include the CLL based on device location. For example:
    
        http://api.yelp.com/v2/search/?term=tacos&location=94127&limit=10&category_filter=food&cll=37.7412617,-122.4649631
    
###### iii. *or* User specifies location:

Use location data specified by user. For example:
    
        http://api.yelp.com/v2/search/?term=tacos&location=1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94132&limit=10&category_filter=food        
    
CLL would be unnecessary in this case.
            
#### 2. Receive a JSON-encoded String response and parse it, making the resultant data available to the front-end.
